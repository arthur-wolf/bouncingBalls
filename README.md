# Bouncing Balls

This is a simple web app that simulates balls bouncing in your screen. They even change color when they touch each other !

A white evil circle has been added so that you can interact with the animation.
You can move it around using your WASD keys, and upon touching a ball, it will
make it disappear. Try to clean the screen !
